# Simple EMR System

This code can be used for Electronic Medical Record Research.

## Getting Started

First, have a look in the screenshots directory to become familiar with the interface design. 

### Prerequisites

Python 3 or Docker Compose

### Installing


#### Python 

1. Clone repository
2. cd into project directory
3. enter "pip install -r requirements.txt"

#### Docker

1. Clone repository 

#### Python installation notes
It is strongly recommended that you use a virtual environment.
1. if you do not have virtualenv, enter "pip install virtualenv"
2. enter "python -m venv __name_of_environment__"
3. enter "__name_of_environment__/Scripts/activate"
4. then follow the Python installation instructions shown above
5. to terminate the virtual environment, enter "deactivate"

### Deployment

##### Python 

1. cd into project directory
2. enter "python manage.py runserver"
3. open web browser to http://127.0.0.1:8000/SEMRinterface/
4. terminate using ctrl+c

#### Docker
1. cd into project directory 
2. enter "docker-compose up"
3. open web browser to http://127.0.0.1:8000/SEMRinterface/
4. terminate using ctrl+c

### Notes

The SEMRinterface in meant to run in full screen mode on a 1920 x 1080 resolution monitor. Responsive html is not
currently supported. 

## Secondary Use

### Included data
Two example studies are included in the Simple EMR System repository: demo_study and synthea_study. Demo_study includes three synthetic patient cases created by scrambling the contents of de-identified records from a larger set of patients from a hospital’s Cerner EMR system. Synthea_study includes 25 intensive care unit (ICU) encounters from the Synthea COVID-19 dataset (available at https://synthea.mitre.org/downloads).

Included case data can be found at:
1. https://github.com/ajk77/SimpleEMRSystem/tree/master/resources/synthea_study
2. https://github.com/ajk77/SimpleEMRSystem/tree/master/resources/demo_study (update coming soon)

### Importing custom patient data
To preprocess Synthea cases for display on the Simple EMR System: 
1. Download the source data and extract it into the ‘resources’ folder. 
2. Adjust parameters, such as the input and output directories, in the Synthea data loading script (‘loaddata_synthea.py’) and execute the script. 
3. View details about each processed case in ‘list_case_dicts.json’. 
4. Select cases to use in the study and add them to ‘case_details.json’ 
5. assign them to users in ‘user_details.json’. 
6. adjust display groups, medication routes, display names, and display locations in ‘variable_details.json,’ ‘med_details.json,’ and ‘data_layout.json.’ 

To load in data from other sources, you will need to create a custom 'loaddata' file. If your data source is a database, consider usings Django's Models.py (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/db/models/). 

You may also edit JSON file directly in order to create custom cases.

### Eye-tracking research
Components related to eye-tracking are turned off in this version because accuracy across different environments can 
not be guaranteed. If you are interested in using SEMRinterface with a remote eye-tracking device, please see the

* Eye-tracking for clinical decision support: A method to capture automatically what physicians are viewing in 
the EMR (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28815151>)
